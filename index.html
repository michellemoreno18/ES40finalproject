        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p id="first-paragraph">
            Established in Montebello, this community library is a space for students of all ages to do school work, research new topics (using the library's databases), starting new projects, or reading in a cozy atmosphere. With our library having three floors, students are able to socialize and have a cup of coffee on the first floor. On the main floor we serve coffee and pastries. Here on the first floor you can access microwaves and we also rent out other supplies. The second floor is dedicated to studying or reading. The second floor offers multiple study rooms, conference rooms, and a computer lab ready to be reserved for class projects, club meetings, or zoom calls. The floor contains multiple printers and IT workers (university students) for any tech assistance. Lastly, the third floor is the quiet zone for students who prefer a quiet environment. We designed the building with the intention of helping people in Montebello to concentrate on their studies and encourage them to continue their education. We have also built with the intention to make it a safe space for many, whether it is to browse youtube videos in the computer lab, reading for fun, or listening to music (with headphones on please). This remodel was inspired by students from Montebello who noticed the importance of study spaces and accessibility for many students of the area.
