                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p id="first-paragraph">
                            Established in Montebello, this community library is a space for 
                            students of all ages to do school work, research new topics (using 
                            the library's databases), starting new projects, or reading in a 
                            cozy atmosphere. With our library having three floors, students 
                            are able to socialize and have a cup of coffee on the first floor. 
                            On the main floor we serve coffee and pastries. Here on the first 
                            floor you can access microwaves and we also rent out other supplies. 
                            The second floor is dedicated to studying or reading. The second 
                            floor offers multiple study rooms, conference rooms, and a computer 
                            lab ready to be reserved for class projects, club meetings, or zoom 
                            calls. The floor contains multiple printers and IT workers (university 
                            students) for any tech assistance. Lastly, the third floor is the quiet 
                            zone for students who prefer a quiet environment. We designed the 
                            building with the intention of helping people in Montebello to concentrate 
                            on their studies and encourage them to continue their education. We have 
                            also built with the intention to make it a safe space for many, whether 
                            it is to browse youtube videos in the computer lab, reading for fun, or 
                            listening to music (with headphones on please). This remodel was inspired 
                            by students from Montebello who noticed the importance of study spaces and 
                            accessibility for many students of the area. 
                        </p>

                    <h2> Library Changes</h2>
                        <p id="second-paragraph">
                            To make the library more sustainable, we have planned to add more underground parking
                            that will eliminate big pavements that are exposed to the sun. The rooftop will be 
                            covered in solar panels, where most of our energy will come from. For the parking lots
                            which are currently being used, outside of the underground parking lot, we will add 
                            electric car changing stations. 
                        </p>

                        <p id="third-paragraph">
                            As for materials and resources for making the second floor of the story, the majority of 
                            the building materials contain significant recycled content, such as the flooring (hardwood,
                            carpet, tile), concrete, etc. We also plan to manufacture the building materials locally.
                            Any new materials, such as wood, we plan to use from sustainable forests. 
                        </p>

                        <p id="fourth-paragraph">
                            To enhance indoor environmental quality, smoking in the library will not be permitted or in 
                            the parking lot. To support safety and health of the people in the library, fresh air will 
                            be blended in the mechanical system. We will utilize natural sunlight, but on days of hotter 
                            climate, we will use a window covering system that will reduce heat gain. Paint, adhesive, and
                            sealants we use will contain little to none volatile organic compounds.
