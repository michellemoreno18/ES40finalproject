        <h2 id="title">March 2021: Literacy Foundations and 
            Organizations</h2>
        <p id="second-paragraph">
            This month we would like to focus on organizations and foundations
            addressing illeracy at a young age as well as with adults. Approximately
            45 million Americans are functionally illerate and cannot read above 
            fifth grade level and half of adults cannot read a book written at an eighth-grade 
            level(Literacy Project). We want to help those who are harmed by lack of access
            and education. There are ways to help literacy learners and one of the ways
            you can help is donate money or time to literacy organizations and foundations.
            We are also in the process of organizing an event for spreading awareness and 
            opportunities to help youth and adult literacy learners. Below are resources for 
            organizations as well as a video that can offer more information about youth and adult literacy learners.
